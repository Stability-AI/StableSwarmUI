# Status

This project is in **Beta** status. This means for most tasks, Swarm has excellent tooling available to you, but there is much more planned. Swarm is recommended as an ideal UI for most users, beginners and pros alike. There are still some things to be worked out.

Beginner users will love Swarm's primary Generate tab interface, making it easy to generate anything with a variety of powerful features. Advanced users may favor the Comfy Workflow tab to get the unrestricted raw graph, but will still have reason to come back to the Generate tab for convenience features (image editor, auto-workflow-generation, etc) and powertools (eg Grid Generator).

Those interested in helping push Swarm from Beta to a Full ready-for-anything perfected Release status are welcome to submit PRs (read the [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) document first), and you can contact us here on GitHub or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/q2y38cqjNw). I highly recommended reaching out to ask about plans for a feature before PRing it. There may already be specific plans or even a work in progress.

Key feature targets not yet implemented:
- Better mobile browser support
- full detail "Current Model" display in UI, separate from the model selector (probably as a tab within the batch sidebar?)
    - And a way to dynamically shift tabs around between spots for convenience / layout customization
- LLM-assisted prompting
- convenient direct-distribution of Swarm as a program (Electron app?)

# Try It On Cloud GPU's

**WARNING**: Google Colab does not necessarily allow remote WebUIs, particularly for free accounts, use at your own risk.

Colab link if you want to try Swarm: https://colab.research.google.com/github/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI/blob/master/colab/colab-notebook.ipynb

Runpod link if you want to try Swarm: https://runpod.io/console/deploy?template=u7mlkrmxq3&ref=c6jd6jj0

With easy Jupyter Lab already setup ^^

# Installing on Windows

Note: if you're on Windows 10, you may need to manually install [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and [DotNET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) first. (Windows 11 this is automated).

- Download [The Install-Windows.bat file](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI/releases/download/0.6.1-Beta/install-windows.bat), store it somewhere you want to install at (not `Program Files`), and run it.
    - It should open a command prompt and install itself.
    - If it closes without going further, try running it again, it sometimes needs to run twice. (TODO: Fix that)
    - It will place an icon on your desktop that you can use to re-launch the server at any time.
    - When the installer completes, it will automatically launch the StableSwarmUI server, and open a browser window to the install page.
    - Follow the install instructions on the page.
    - After you submit, be patient, some of the install processing take a few minutes (downloading models and etc).

(TODO): Even easier self-contained pre-installer, a `.msi` or `.exe` that provides a general install screen and lets you pick folder and all.

# Alternate Manual Windows Install

- Install git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Install DotNET 8 SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0 (Make sure to get the SDK x64 for Windows)
- open a terminal to the folder you want swarm in and run `git clone https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI`
- open the folder and run `launch-windows.bat`

# Installing on Linux

- Install `git`, `python3` via your OS package manager if they are not already installed (make sure to include `pip` and `venv` on distros that do not include them in python directly)
    - For example, on recent Ubuntu versions, `sudo apt install git python3-pip python3-venv`
- Download [the install-linux.sh file](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI/releases/download/0.6.1-Beta/install-linux.sh), store it somewhere you want to install at, and run it
    - If you like terminals, you can open a terminal to the folder and run the following commands:
        - `wget https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI/releases/download/0.6.1-Beta/install-linux.sh -O install-linux.sh`
        - `chmod +x install-linux.sh`
- Run the `./install-linux.sh` script, it will install everything for you and eventually open the webpage in your browser.
- Follow the install instructions on-page.

- You can at any time in the future run the `launch-linux.sh` script to re-launch Swarm.
- If the page doesn't open itself, you can manually open `http://localhost:7801`

# Alternate Manual Linux Install

- Install `git`, `python3` via your OS package manager if they are not already installed (make sure to include `pip` and `venv` on distros that do not include them in python directly)
    - For example, on recent Ubuntu versions, `sudo apt install git python3-pip python3-venv`
- Install DotNET 8 using the instructions at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0 (you need `dotnet-sdk-8.0`, as that includes all relevant sub-packages)
    - Some users [have said](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI/pull/6) that certain Linux distros expect `aspnet-runtime` to be installed separately
- Open a shell terminal and `cd` to a directory you want to install into
- Run shell commands:
    - `git clone https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI`
    - cd `StableSwarmUI`
    - `./launch-linux.sh`
- open `http://localhost:7801/Install` (if it doesn't launch itself)
- Follow the install instructions on-page.

(TODO): Maybe outlink a dedicated document with per-distro details and whatever. Maybe also make a one-click installer for Linux?

# Installing on Mac

> **Note**: You can only run StableSwarmUI on Mac computers with M1 or M2 (Mx) Apple silicon processors.

1. Open Terminal.
2. Ensure your `brew` packages are updated with `brew update`.
3. Verify your `brew` installation with `brew doctor`. You should not see any error in the command output.
4. Install .NET for macOS: `brew install dotnet`.
5. Change the directory (`cd`) to the folder where you want to install StableSwarmUI.
6. Clone the StableSwarmUI GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI`.
7. `cd StableSwarmUI` and run the installation script: `./launch-macos.sh`.

The installation starts now and downloads the Stable Diffusion models from the internet. Depending on your internet connection, this may take several minutes. Wait for your web browser to open the StableSwarmUI window.

> During the StableSwarmUI installation, you are prompted for the type of backend you want to use. For Mac computers with M1 or M2, you can safely choose the ComfyUI backend and choose the Stable Diffusion XL Base and Refiner models in the Download Models screen.

# Running with Docker

- To forward an Nvidia GPU, you must have the Nvidia Container Toolkit installed: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html
- Open a shell terminal and `cd` to a directory you want to install into
- Run shell commands:
    - `git clone https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI`
    - cd `StableSwarmUI`
    - `./launch-docker.sh`
    - Open your browser to `localhost:7801`
- Note that it will forward the `Models` and `Output` directory, and will mount `Data` and `dlbackend` as independent persistent volumes.

# Documentation

See [the documentation folder](/docs/README.md).

# Motivations

The "Swarm" name is in reference to the original key function of the UI: enabling a 'swarm' of GPUs to all generate images for the same user at once (especially for large grid generations). This is just the feature that inspired the name and not the end all of what Swarm is.

The overall goal of StableSwarmUI is to a be full-featured one-stop-shop for all things Stable Diffusion.

See [the motivations document](/docs/Motivations.md) for motivations on technical choices.
